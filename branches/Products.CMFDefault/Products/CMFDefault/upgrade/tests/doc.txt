Testing Upgrade Steps
---------------------

Introduction
============

An upgrade step is regsitered for upgrading from one version of CMF to another. As the we do not store what profiles have been used (which base profile and which extensions) an upgrade step will always run on the default profile. An upgrade step for a particular profile must, therefore, run a check for the existence of the relevant change (action, type, skin, etc.) to avoid being run when not required. If the check is not done then tests will always fail. In addition the relevant profile needs to be added to the test layer. I

Adding a tests for an extension profile
=======================================

CMFDefault.testing sets up a CMF site with the CMFDefault profile as base. When testing an extension profile the site must also be set up with the relevant extension profile. The profile_is should also be set in the test.

Add a test site for upgrading
=============================

Create a CMF Site with the version of CMF that is to be upgraded. Export the site and add the .zexp file to this test folder with a relevant name, ie. cmf22_view_support.zexp for upgrading from CMF 2.2
