'absolut' profile
=================

This profile supplies an alternate main template to the one provided
in the 'zpt_generic' skins directory. The skin does pure CSS and
requires browsers to support CSS 2.1. HTML5 is used for semantic
clarity and reliable rendering (it enforces "strict").
A Javascript shim enables HTML5 tags for IE <= 8.

Like the were and ursa skins it uses the ursa globals
